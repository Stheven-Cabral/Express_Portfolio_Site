# Express_Portfolio_Site
 Sixth Full Stack JavaScript Techdgree Project

In this project I built a express portfolio site that highlights six projects that I have built. The profile site contains an about me page, a project summary page, and pages for each project. All the project data is accessed from a data.json file, and I used Pug to render the different pages of my profile site.

Use the projects page to access each project and view more details, technologies used, and links to view the working web application or interface.

My Extra Credit Style Changes:
- Changed the body background color to a super light teal #f1ffff.
- Changed '.porfolio-me' background color to #2b1414.
- Changed h1 fonts to 'Archivo Black'.
- Added box shadows to project thumbs and example photos.
- Added a transform property to the project thumbnails, which expands the thumbnail on hover by scale of 1.04.
- Changed 'Live Demo' and 'GitHub Repo' button background colors to #2b1414.
